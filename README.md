Notes and Implementations for Harvard Biostatistics course BST 234 "Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms"

Additional examples from *Algorithms* by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Christos Papadimitriou, and Umesh Vazirani.

This is not extremely well organized and is primarily for my personal use.

`Notes.pdf` is the slide deck for the course with some of my handwritten annotations.
